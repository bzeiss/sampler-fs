# Test wave files

These are wave files which are embedded in the test images.

The test files used for the reversing effort are documented in this [Excel file](https://github.com/bzeiss/sampler-fs/blob/main/AxK/test-images/axk-test-images.xlsx). The attempt to use the wiki for this purpose unfortunately failed and wasn't properly readable.
