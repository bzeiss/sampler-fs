# Sample disk images of A3000 disk

At the moment one disk image which consists of 8GB disk (maximum size of the AxK samplers)
just after partitioning in the sampler (8 partitions รก 1GB)

The disk was zeroed before installing in the A3K to allow for good compression of the image.
It can be read directly as a stream from python with the gzip module or encoding. So no need to waste disk space with the expannded file.




## Usage/Examples

```bash
host$ czat A3K_Disk_partioned.img.gz | hexdump -c | less
```
